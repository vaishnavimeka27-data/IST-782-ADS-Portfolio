# Rubric for Final Project

Your final report will follow the format of a standard scientific report, and will be written in **markdown** format, but submitted along with supporting jupyter notebooks.  Please do **not** submit data directly, but instead provide links where the data can be retrieved, or (if the data cannot be readily shared) where the data is described.  

**All submission files will be saved in the same directory as this rubric**. The report will be named "report.md."  Only the point of contact needs to submit a final project, and the point of contact will be responsible for sharing feedback with the group.

Failure to follow the above instructions will result in an automatic 2 point deduction without exception. Your report will have the following sections.

### Title

A nice short title for your project, helping me to understand roughly what it is you are trying to do.

### Team

Each project will have a team of 3-5 people, an one person will serve as the point of contact for the team who will "own" the repository.  Everyone will be granted access to this repository.  This section should include the full names of each team member, **along with their github ids**, and indicate the point of contact for the group.

### Introduction

This section will introduce your project.  It will tell me what are you trying to do, and who your primary stakeholder is. It will also explain the stakeholder need(s) that you are trying to address, and explain why this is a significant need. You will also briefly summarize your results here. This section should be no more than a few paragraphs in length.  

### Literature Review

This section will provide additional detail about your problem; feel free to copy some of this from your proposal. I would like you to clearly establish your stakeholder need(s), and then tell me why you chose the methods you chose based on prior work and the nature of your problem. If no one has worked on your problem (unlikely) you can say that, but should then talk about related problems that apply similar methods.

### Data and Methods

This section will introduce your data and specify your modeling approach.

#### Data

This will describe your dataset, including where you got it from and how you know it's good data.  It will include some discussion of your data - e.g., the number of rows and columns, types of features, balance and across classes.  You can include some images (1-3) here if they are helpful, but this is only necessary if it will help the reader to understand some of the challenges you faced. For instance, if there is a distribution you'd like to showcase, or if you want to show a particular instance of data.  Your jupyter notebook can contain additional analysis from your EDA.

#### Methods

Describe your methods.  Explain any preprocessing or data transformations that were necessary. Then explain the methods that you used and how you applied them.  If you tried multiple methods that didn't work, please explain what you did and why they didn't work. If your methods are novel or were not discussed in class, please explain these to provide me with and understanding of the method and confidence that you've applied the methods correctly. Do **not** include results here; this section is intended to give the reader an overview of the steps taken. If you tried some things that didn't work, you can explain that here, but please be clear about what your final approach was.

### Results

Share the outcomes of your work here.  Make sure to include appropriate metrics (note, accuracy score is usually not enough) and explain how these metrics were generated (in most cases, you will be using n-fold cross validation).  If you examined feature importance or clustered your data, provide your results here.  This section should include visualizations and or tables to illustrate your results, but please only include results necessary to support your claims. Any additional results can be left in the notebooks, and you can indicate these results may be found there. Additionally, if you created a prototype, please include a screenshot of the prototype; if the prototype is accessible either via a local server or the web, make sure I know how to run the code but do *not* include that here.  Instead, include an appendix, a footnote or a jupyter notebook with instructions.


### Discussion

Use this section to reflect on your results and tell me to what degree you achieved your goals.  Please be frank about this!  If you don't think you did, the simply tell me that and explain why.  Critically, you will reflect on your stakeholder needs, and explain how your work addresses those stakeholder needs.

### Limitations

Please explain how your work is limited - that is, how could it be better?  What would you have liked to have done but were not able to?  If you address some, but not all, of your envisioned stakeholder needs, explain what those are. How could you make your work more robust?  Are there reasons to be concerned about the quality of your results or performance scores?  Be critical of your own work, so that I don't have to.

### Future work

This should be self-explanatory - what are you next steps?  Where would you like to go from here?

---

I am not going to provide a detailed rubric here, as every project should have different emphasis and it's not reasonable to provide a granular breakdown.  I will provide written feedback to justify your final grade.
